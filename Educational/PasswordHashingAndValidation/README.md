# Password Hashing and Validation

## Description

The **Password Hashing and Validation** project is focused on secure password handling using Python. This application demonstrates how to hash passwords securely and validate them during authentication. The hashing is performed using the SHA-256 algorithm, a widely used and secure hashing function.

## Features

- **Hash Passwords**: Convert plain-text passwords into SHA-256 hashes.
- **Validate Passwords**: Check if a provided password matches a stored hash.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Interact with the application through a simple CLI.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Used for implementing password hashing, validation, and user interaction.

## Installation

No additional installation is required beyond Python itself. To use the application, simply ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the Python script from the command line:

   ```bash
   python password_manager.py
