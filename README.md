# PyProjects

Welcome to the PyProjects repository! This repository is dedicated to hosting a collection of my educational, practice, and personal projects, primarily focused on Python. Here, you will find various projects that range from simple scripts and tutorials to more complex applications and experiments.

## Purpose

The PyProjects repository serves as a central hub for my journey in learning and mastering Python. It includes:

- **Educational Projects**: Code samples, exercises, and tutorials that Iâ€™ve worked on to understand Python concepts and programming techniques better.
- **Practice Projects**: Small-scale projects and challenges that I have undertaken to practice and refine my coding skills.
- **Personal Projects**: Individual projects and tools that I have developed for personal use or out of personal interest.

## Repository Structure

- **/Educational/**: Contains projects related to learning Python, such as tutorials, site clones, and code exercises.
- **/Practice Problems/**: Houses practice projects, coding challenges, and solutions.
- **/personal/**: Includes personal projects, tools, and experiments.
